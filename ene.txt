#BLURB
And when at last it is time for the transition from megacorporation
to planetary government, from entrepreneur to emperor, it is
then that the true genius of our strategy shall become apparent,
for energy is the lifeblood of this society and when the chips
are down he who controls the energy supply controls Planet.
In former times the energy monopoly was called "The Power Company";
we intend to give this name an entirely new meaning.

"War is bad for business, and is extremely draining to the energy
grid. A Blood Truce is therefore in order, yes?"

"Sure, but you will have to cease your monopolistic ways."
"No, I will get rid of your filthy energy monopoly with extreme prejudice."

"$TITLE0 $NAME1, we can produce much more energy if we tie our
power grids to each other's. Let us make Treaty and reap the
benefits of mutual energy sharing."
