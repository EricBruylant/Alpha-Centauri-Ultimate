#BLURB
First there was darkness. Then came the Strangers. They were a
race as old as time itself. They had mastered the untimate ability:
To alter prysical reality by will alone. But they were dying.
They left their world, seeking a cure for their mortality. Their
endless journeu brought them to a small, blue world. [Our] world.
