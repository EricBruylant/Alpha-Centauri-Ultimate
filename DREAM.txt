#BLURB
We intend to cultivate this world into the wilderness paradise
that Earth once was, to have again that which our ancestors had
and dwell in peace upon fertile fields, to hunt the wild animals
we brought from our homeland once we have a large enough population.
We will indeed, live as our ancestors once did.
