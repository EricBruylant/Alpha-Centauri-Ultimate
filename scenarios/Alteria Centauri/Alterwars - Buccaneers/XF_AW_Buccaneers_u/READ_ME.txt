>>Scenario Targets:
  Mining Colony ORE-WELL-S23/P3/M2
  In the year 2098 Morgan Industries established a mining colony 
  on the second moon, third planet, planetary system 23. 
  Nwabudike Morgan, the youngest son of general director Massabe Morgan, 
  leads this colony to learn the rules of business from scratch. 
  Due to the barren lands of Ore Well food is very rare. 
  But Nwabudike managed it to make a contract with Zion Hydroponics Inc. 
  The ZH Agrar Conglomerates are specialized in Low Gravity Farming in hostile areas. 
  Agricultural Specialist Miriam Godwinson provides the mining facilities 
  with fresh nutrients from her hothouses. 
  Meanwhile the two are running a profitable business.

  But profit attracts others also.

  The Spartan Liberation Army, as always low on resources and money, 
  spotted this valuable target.
  Short time after, they land a small pirate vessel somewhere in the 
  wastelands of the Ore Well moon.

  Needless to say what their greedy hands want to grab...
