A ruined city decades old lies here. Your troops set up camp here
to investigate it. One evening, two soldiers intoxicate themselves,
then decide to see who can breathe the native atmosphere the
longest. Upon exposure to the atmosphere, they immediately notice
a pungent, foul odor - that of rotting meat mixed with compost.
More sober investigations show extensive catacombs beneath the
city, where many dead lie entombed and where vast quantities of
raw goods and materials are stored.
