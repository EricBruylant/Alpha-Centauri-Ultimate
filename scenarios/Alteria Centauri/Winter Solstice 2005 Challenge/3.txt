A time capsule is visible at the bottom of a waterfall. Its contents include:

A child's drawing of a man with a white and black beard, and a blue hat. Signed, P.L.
Legal documents proclaiming various rights for all people.
Encrypted computer files.
A tiny vial of water.
A shredder pistol modified for use as a hypodermic spray.

(You may replace drone.txt with drone2.txt by renaming drone.txt, then
renaming drone2.txt drone.txt, then using Menu -> Scenario -> Reload Faction
to reload the Drone faction file. This adds ROBUST, SUPPORT to the Drone faction,
as they are inspired to support a democracy by the legal documents.)

(This is one of two discoveries necessary to view a.txt. When you have found
the other, also read a.txt)
