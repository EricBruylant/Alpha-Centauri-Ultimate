A ruined base lies here. Despite Cultist influence, many Spartan records and logs
have endured, buried under rock or destroyed rovers. One soldier finds the following
account:

MY 2166, day 165: Cult impact infantry repulsed, minimal casualties.
MY 2166, day 166: Massive explosion nearby. Scout rover detachment sent to investigate.
MY 2166, day 168: Scouts returned towing large, unidentifiable vehicles. Scientists
assigned to investigate.
MY 2166, day 174: Vehicles recovered six days prior appear to have combat function.
MY 2166, day 176: Cult forces using new tactics - powerful new lasers combined with
chemical weapons. Nonessential services suspended.
MY 2166, day 181: Scientists activate vehicles recovered thirteen days prior.
Incredible combat potential. Cultist forces routed and pursued.
MY 2166, day 194: Local probe operatives found in comas. Base security compromised.
New weapons evacuated for safekeeping in the mouth of the wolf.
