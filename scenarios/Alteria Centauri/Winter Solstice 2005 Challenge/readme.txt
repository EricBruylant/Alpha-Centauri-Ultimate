The story:
In 2145, Foreman Domai led a strike at Morgan Mines. It was brutally suppressed,
but Domai and some followers escaped, helped frequently by an unknown Sinder Roze.
Morgan put increasingly large bounties on Domai's head, but was cruelly taught that
money can't buy everything when shareholders in several major corporations withdrew
their support for Morgan. Two days later, he was arrested on charges of fraud.
Damning evidence surfaced, including some tapes Morgan swore under lie detection
were not of him. He was swiftly convicted and imprisoned, but while the business
world was distracted, Sinder Roze completed her takeover, and began transforming
Morgan's faction.

Domai eventually fled across the ocean, unaware he was no longer being pursued.
There, he founded a communist society, of the worker and for the worker. He
worked singlemindedly for the prosperity of his people until his death last year
of emphysema, perhaps triggered by poor working conditions among the Morganites,
or perhaps an unforseen complication of cryogenic sleep. You were installed as
the new leader, to carry on Domai's legacy and bring true communism to all of Planet.

Unfortunately, Domai was neither educated nor intelligent. You now know that
Domai made some very poor choices, and your research program is in shambles.
Even worse, rumors of weapon-bearing aliens are circulating amidst your drones.
Perhaps your old contact Sinder Roze can help?
