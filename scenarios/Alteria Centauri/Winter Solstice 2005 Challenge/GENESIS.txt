"My researchers and I have had enouth of this pointless war, $TITLE0 
$NAME1! Won't you sign peace with us, lest you fall victim to my nano viruses?"

"Very well, but my people are not comfortable with your experimentation."
"Too bad, $NAME3. I guess your nano-freaks cannot save you from me!"

"You seem a prudent leader, $NAME1. I see that both of our medical 
initiatives would benefit from a Treaty of Friendship between our two factions."

"Of course. From penicillin to nanobots, medicine has improved our lives."
"No. Rumors abound of your research on unwilling human subjects."

$NAME3! I shall exterminate your pityful species unless you Pledge Truce!"

"Progenitor: fear disease. Pledge Truce: mighty Genesis."
