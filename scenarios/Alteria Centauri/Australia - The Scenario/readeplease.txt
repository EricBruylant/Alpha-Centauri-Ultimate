--AUSTRALIA scenario--

Thanks for downloading this scenerio.

This is my second scenario I've made for SMAC. I decided to do this one because since
I live in Australia and there were other country maps out there, Australia should be
with them as well. You will notice some landmarks and also some other realistic touches
such as Uranium near Jabaluka, Great Barrier Reef and no Tasmania 'cause it's not part
of Australia (just joking). The starting location for each faction is a capital city of
Australia except Canberra and Hobart (there wasn't much room to expand) so Yang moved
to Alice. The factions have been located to each state becuase of there personality or
the look of the faction (Peacekeeper's base look's like St Peter's Cathedral, UoP
is in Melbourne because of Monash Uni, etc.)
If you're Australian or you know quite a bit about it here, you'll notice alot of familiar
places.

*There is also a map version out if you do not want to play the scenario. It should be 
in the maps section of the site you downloaded this scenario from.*

INSTALLATION: Extract files into new folder Australia in the scenario folder.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE: To acheive the highest score to win.

Note: Base population, research, territory etc. count as objective points that
will contribute to the overall score.

DIFFICULTY: Thinker (default)

Tips: *Expand early as Australia is a large continent
      *Ally as much as possible to avoid conflict (esp. those near the eastern coast)
      *If you're the Morgan or Miriam, expand as a top piority as you have the most space
      *The geography resembles Australia but there are some other things to watch out for :-)

If you find any errors or bugs in this scenario, please don't hesitate to e-mail me about them.

Thanks.
