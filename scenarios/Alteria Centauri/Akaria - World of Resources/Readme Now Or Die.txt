DATALINKS: NODE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
Just unzip all of the stuff in the zip file to:

C:\Program Files\Alpha Centauri\Scenarios\Akaria

(Or whatever your SMAC directory is...)

Then go ahead and play the scenario. If you wish then you can
read the rest of this document...

(I suggest that you do...)

DATALINKS: HISTORY

More than 800 years have passed since Planetfall. Three factions
acheived Space Flight earlier than the other factions and took to 
space. Over-population on Planet had made factions look for new
planets for colonisation. The fourth planet from Alpha Centauri's
primary was small. Yet considering that it was somewhere to expand to
factions started arguing over who should get the planet. Eventually
the three factions: Morgans, Peacekeepers and Spatians, took to 
space and headed for the planet which became known as Akaria.
The Spatians were there first and launched satillits into orbit. They
have a complete knowledge of the map at the start. The other factions
didn't have time and just performed a quick servey on the way in.
What they found startled them: Certain types of resources has grown
together! So while one area was abundant in food the other was not!
The factions managed to subtistute the resources that were missing 
from there borders by terraforming there land. However as every good
leader knows a faction needs all three to survive the diplomatic tension
between the factions broke down into war...

People on Akaria started to get worried and angry about not having enough 
food or not having enough building materials that they grabbed some weapons
and ran away into the countryside. These 'barbarians' will attack anyone.
They don't have advanced weaponry but could cause harm if they attack lightly
defended or under-defended battalions. As far as we know they don't have a base
of operations and there are only a few of them. Don't let colony pods leave your
borders without escort.

A few days before the wars break out supply ships from each faction
brings fresh supplies and drops them off in the centre of your territory.

DATALINKS: FACTION INFORMATION

The Spartians start with all of the natural mineral resources and rocky 
areas on the planet. Thereby supplementing their natural industry loss.
The Morgans start with all of the natural energy sources and high mountains 
to put solor collecters on and get lots of credits...
And the Peacekeepers start with all the natural nutrient resources and 
the Jungle of Nubius! They start with a higher population and one more base
than the other factions!

Tech progresses at the normal rate.
Certain factions have been 'handicapped'. See FACTION PROFILES for more
info!

The objectives are simple: Control 19 of the 21 objective bases by 3050 to win.
You have over 170 turns to acheive your victory conditions.
Cooperative victory is enabled and is recommended.
Each faction starts with six bases, except for the Peacekeepers which start with
seven. This mimicks there high food production.
There is limited land so either build sea bases or raise land with Formers.

DATALINKS: FACTION PROFILES

The Spartians should build condensors, farms, and solor collectors to enhance
their bases nutrient and energy production. However since they are on low
areas this dosn't provide much of a bonus.
They should build mines on mineral outcrops and rocky areas. 
The Spatians should build up a huge army using the mineral outcrops and take
over objectives.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
The Morgans should also build farms and especially solor collectors.
Due to the mountians regions that are under Morganic control they will
have lots of rainy areas and this faction should be played if you are new
to SMAC or if you don't fancy that much of a challenge. Except for the
fact that mineral production will be non-existant this is the easiest 
faction to play in this scenario.
They also have a slightly higher tech level than the other two factions and
start with slightly more units. This is because they are in the middle
and they need to defend themselves.
However is should be noted that you are the most likly to go to war with
the Spartians or the Peacekeepers, (how ironic!), because you are in the 
middle.
The Morgans should switch to a Fundamentilist government and build lots of
Probe Teams to subvert enemy bases under there control using all of that
energy that they get off the mountains.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
The Peacekeepers should expand, expand, expand to as many areas as they can!
With the amount of food production coming in there bases should grow to huge
sizes. All you need to do is to build solor collectors and maybe some 
Thermal Boreholes to stimulate mineral production.
The Peacekeepers have all options open to them. They can either get there
borders on some of those Morganic mountians before they do and get lots of
energy then subvert bases...
Or to use sea power to take over the Spartians and their high mineral 
producing bases and then get the Morgans.

All factions territory is already mostly terraformed. Deirdre would go 
mad if she saw what you have done to Akaria!

DATALINKS: NODE BUGS
Only one that I know of:
-The Spatians start with a full knowledge of the map. I don't know why.
Other factions start with there surrounding area known.
To make this not seem like a bug I have included that info in the story.

If you find any more then e-mail me and I will try and fix them.

DATALINKS: NODE DISTRIBRUTION
If you wish to distribrute this in ANY format from anywhere but
the site where this scenario was originally uploaded then you MUST ask
me first. I will gladly let you but you MUST NOTIFIY ME!
You can also use this as a base for your own work as long as you 
TELL ME and give me (some) credit.

COMMUNICATIONS ARRAY ACTIVATED:
If you have any suggestions, problems, complaints etc, please contact
me at 'dane.elwell@lineone.net'.
This is the first version of this scenario and is my first ever scenario
anyway. I want to improve this scenario and in the next version I _might_
replace the Spartians with one of my own factions as they upset the balance
of the game, but hey, putting the Hive or Belivers in there wouldn't have
done much good, and since there is no fungus the Gaians would have been useless
and with the University there would have been no motivation to build an army
and conquer your neighbours.

Keep a look out for my next scenario: "Nessus Prime: Minerals in Abundance"

Don't forget to visit my web site which is all about strategy games,
especially SMAC, and take a look round. If I can I'll put this scenario
up on that site too! I am especially proud of my patented unit designes.

Until then! Enjoy playing!

Right I'll shut up now...

Go away...



























Okay then since you have come this far I'll let you into a little strategy
that always works for me when I play SMAC. 

Clean Reactors.

Put them on EVERY unit that either dosn't require the two slots for it to
function as it was intended or is a Garrison/Sentinal unit. I know that they
are expensive but not that much. Especially if you have high producing bases.
Then all you have to do is crank out as many units as possible and send them
over to your enemy. All this WITHOUT losing production from supporting units.
It is a never ending circle.
Democracy is an option in war now.
Trust me.
Do this when you get Chaos Guns and Silksteel armour! If you get them before
your enemy does, as I almost always do, then do that strategy and BANG, you win.
Also if you get hovertanks before your enemies do you can overrun them with them.
Go to the units section at my site and use the Tank MkI and the Behemoth MkII designes.
They rule.
























Go away now please.
Just go to my site at: http://website.lineone.net/~dane.elwell for more 
strategys and hints.
Right now THAT IS REALLY IT.
