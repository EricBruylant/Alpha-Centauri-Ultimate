^Trade Outpost CROOKED CROSS (Outer Colony Ring)
^In the year 2077 Morgan Industries established a Trade Outpost on this small world. 
Rich Resources and the vicinity to profitable merchant routes made it possible to become an important part of the industrial empire of Morgan.
^Three years later the fast growth of Crooked Cross attracted lots of urban refugees to settle on this wealthy planet. 
^Zion Hydroponics Inc. founded a fertile collective of religious farmers and ranchers.
Short time after Crooked Cross evolved to a market that delivers minerals and food to the whole Outer Colony Ring.
^But one day the Spartan Liberation Army (SLA), an interstellar gang of mercenaries, claimed land on Crooked Cross.
They revealed a dubious contract with FarOutExploration (FOE), the company that discovered Crooked Cross in the year 2067.
The contract implied that the SLA bought a quarter of the landmass of Crooked Cross from FOE.
^And the FLA had good lawyers, so the United Nations Colony Administration (UNCA) had to hand out the land.
^Due to this unique legal decision, the UNCA demanded a constant presence to protect the rights of the colonists.
The Colony Courts decided to allow an armed police force on Crooked Cross.
^Until now the planetary peace is stable. But tensions between the factions are growing...
