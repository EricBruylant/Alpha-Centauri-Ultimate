^  As the United Nations learned so painfully in Earth's final century,
a reliable law is the only safeguard against tyranny.
The once-chained people whose leaders at last lose their grip on
justice will soon burst with freedom and vitality, but
the free nation gradually constricting its grip on public discourse
has begun its rapid slide into despotism. Beware of he who would
deny you access to justice, for in his heart he dreams himself
your master.
