>>Scenario Targets:
  Trade Outpost CROOKED CROSS (Outer Colony Ring)
  In the year 2077 Morgan Industries established a Trade Outpost on this small world. 
  Rich Resources and the vicinity to profitable merchant routes made it possible 
  to become an important part of the industrial empire of Morgan.
  Three years later the fast growth of Crooked Cross attracted lots of 
  urban refugees to settle on this wealthy planet. 
  Zion Hydroponics Inc. founded a fertile collective of religious farmers and ranchers.
  Short time after Crooked Cross evolved to a market that delivers minerals and food 
  to the whole Outer Colony Ring.
  
  But one day the Spartan Liberation Army (SLA), an interstellar gang of mercenaries, 
  claimed land on Crooked Cross.
  They revealed a dubious contract with FarOutExploration (FOE), the company that 
  discovered Crooked Cross in the year 2067.
  The contract implied that the SLA bought a quarter of the landmass of Crooked Cross from FOE.
  And the FLA had good lawyers, so the United Nations Colony Administration (UNCA) 
  had to hand out the land.
  
  Due to this unique legal decision, the UNCA demanded a constant presence to protect the 
  rights of the colonists.
  The Colony Courts decided to allow an armed police force on Crooked Cross.
  
  Until now the planetary peace is stable. But tensions between the factions are growing...
