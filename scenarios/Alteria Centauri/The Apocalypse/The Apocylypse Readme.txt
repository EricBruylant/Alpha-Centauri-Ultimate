In this scenario, Zakharov and Deirdre are the two most powerful factions,
so if you're a beginner or a coward, play these two.

The other four are fairly evenly matched, but the Hive are probably the 
most exciting to play as: they're right in the middle.

THERE IS NO NATIVE LIFE IN THIS SCENARIO.

Zakharov is the richest and has the highest tech levels and populations.
Deirdre has a large number of native units.

The Believers have a number of powerful ground units.
The University have the most/best air attack units.
The Believers/Spartans have the best navies.
The Peacekeepers and Hive have the most ground units.
