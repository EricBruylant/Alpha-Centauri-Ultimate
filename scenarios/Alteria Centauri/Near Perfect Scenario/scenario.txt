$TITLE1 $NAME2 of the $FACTION3: As you decend towards
a unknown planet, all seven leaders are eager to set up
the perfect colony. From the looks above, the planet
looks rich in nutrients, minerals and water with no signs
of any alien life form. As you land on the planet, each
faction has been assigned to a equal section of the planet.
Each leader begins to set up headquarters and so the
colonisation begins!
By M.Y. 2600, reach transcendence and build the ultimate
colony with everything to gain the most objective points.
