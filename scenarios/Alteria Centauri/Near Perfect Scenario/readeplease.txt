--NEAR PERFECT PLANET scenario--

Thanks for downloading this scenerio.

As promised, 3 days after releasing the terrain,
here is the scenario. The map has been slighly
imporved with land connecting the north and south
land masses. The land has been equally divided into
7 equal sections for each faction. Please read the
intro for more info.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION: Extract files into new folder Near Perfect Planet in the scenario folder.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE: Reach transcendence (the only way to win) and build the ultimate colony.

Note: Base population, research, territory etc. count as objective points that
will contribute to the overall score.

DIFFICULTY: Thinker (cannot be changed)

Note: The personality of each leader has also been randomised to make it more interesting...

Tips: *Try to set up base early to start research but build bases on productive land.
      *Make researching your top piority as you need to reach transcendence
      *Expand to cover as much territory as possible
      *Build aircrafts to patrol and defend you territory as soon as you have the technology
      *Obviously if you use University then you'll have a head start so when you finish
       it then try another faction to win with

If you find any errors or bugs in this scenario, please don't hesitate to e-mail me about them.

Thanks.
