#caption An unpleasant discovery
^^
$TITLE1 $NAME2 of the $FACTION3: Upon arriving at Chiron, the
Unity probes discover something quite startling. Instead of the 
lush, earthlike planet you had been promised, you stumble upon 
a world of water. A mistake? A conspiracy? It is hardly relevant 
anymore. Luckily, before the crash landing, you and your crewmates 
manage to download the Unity files on seafaring. Just be happy that 
the landing probes can double as personal floatation devices.
