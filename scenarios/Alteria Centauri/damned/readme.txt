Coming of the Damned 
In the year of our lord 2300 the Damned was exiled from Earth 
for crimes against humanity. 40 years later they have arrived 
on planet. They quickly overwhelmed the believers and executed 
sister Miriam. Now the Spartan Federation leads the struggle 
to purge the foul taint of the Damned from planet. Can they hold 
together their alliance of war or will all submit to the rule 
of the damned?

Just unzip the files into a subdir in the senarios folder.
