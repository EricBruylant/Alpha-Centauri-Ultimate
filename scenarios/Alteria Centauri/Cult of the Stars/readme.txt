The Cult of Stars

The Cult of Stars (aka. The Cthulhu Cult) has risen to prominence on Chiron 
and now that the stars are right, they plan to wake the great Cthulhu from his eternal sleep. 
This will result in worldwide madness and riots where humanity will be destroyed. 
The other fractions are divided; some are strongly against the cult's agenda 
but others are having to many internal problems to care. All the while the Mi-Gos 
work to preserve the mining stations they have on Chiron as well as earth, which cannot be
if their ancient enemy are resurrected.
