SMACX Scenario "Old Planet"
---------------------------

based on map "Old Planet (SMACX  Great, 236kb 52x104)"

This scenaro combines the 2 Alien factions of SMACX with 
5 human factions from SMAC:

Gaia, Hive, University, Believers, Peacekeepers
and
Caretakers, Usurpers

Start is set to 2105, the year when the Alien arrive.

All human factions got a city size 2 (otherwise Drone ruits
in difficulty "Transcend" will come, or all factions
have to get Recreation Comm at start) and 2 free Colony Pods, 
1 Former, 2 Scout Patrols + 1 Unity Rover

The Alien factions got a city size 1, 1 free Colony Pod, 1 Former,
1 Scout Patrol and 1 MK1

The starting tech is original as in SMAC resp. SMACX.

The only exception the University is: as the advantage "one free tech
at start" doesn't work in a scenario after building the 1st city, I
gave the University one tech more: Centauri Ecology (similar to that
I do in a game if I play the Uni).

Starting Energy is set to 50 for all human and to 10 for the alien

ini so that the original colors and pictures are used.
