#INTRO
#xs 320
#caption Good news for the unity crew
As your unity pod streaks away towards Planet, you, $TITLE1 $NAME2 of the $FACTION3, 
are pleased that at the last minute your technicians managed to
download a copy of the recovered data from the wreck of the Unity 
that was found by the now asassinated Captain Garland. You thought 
you might have to rebuild everything from scratch, reinvent new 
technologies, recreate civilization anew. But much was saved of 
the original files, which has greatly accelerated your initial progress 
on Planet. From last you heard, the other factions also had the 
exact same data upon their arrival.
^
Your findings have shown Planet to be replete with rolling, 
mountainous terrain, with large tracts of Xenofungus everywhere. 
And then there are the mind worms...
^
But you have not had much luck finding the other factions. 
Until now. As head of the $FACTION3, you have recently acquired 
the commlink signals to two of the other factions. 
^
And until now you have not paid much attention to the survey 
records made by the original Unity pod. Looking again at the 
findings of the pod's AI as it made its way to planetfall, you 
notice several spots on Planet that might be of interest to 
future growth and colonisation. And one picture of what seems 
to be some evidence of debris, or a structure of some sort... 
another faction, or evidence of a non-human civilization? 
You are unsure...
