#BLURB
^  Learn to overcome the crass demands of flesh and bone, for they
warp the matrix through which we perceive the world. Extend your
awareness outwards, beyond the self of body, to embrace the self
of group and the self of humanity. The goals of the group and the
greater race are transcendent, and to embrace them is to achieve
enlightenment.

"As I see no need for this Vendetta to continue, $NAME1,
a pledge of Blood Truce would seem in order."

"Indeed. Blood Truce would be most satisfactory."
"Never! I plan to put an end to your scheming once and for all!"

#FACTIONTREATY

"$TITLE0 $NAME1, your ideals are admirable if a bit misguided and
your faction need not pose a threat to Hive policy. Shall we sign
a Treaty of Friendship to formalize our symbiotic relationship?

"As you wish. The Hive seems a valuable friend."
"No. Your social experiments are a bit too bizarre for me, $NAME3."
