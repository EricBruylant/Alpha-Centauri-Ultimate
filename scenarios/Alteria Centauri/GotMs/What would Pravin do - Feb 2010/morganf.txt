^  Business is good. We have prospered on this new world, and
we will continue to do so. Our markets continue to expand, and
with the dead wood in upper management cleared out, profits are 
anticipated to reach record numbers this quarter. Our founder is
sorely missed, but the turmoil in the wake of his passing has been 
quickly resolved and we will follow his successful vision into the 
future to the profit of all.
