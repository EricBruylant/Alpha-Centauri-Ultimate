#BLURB
^  The tragedy that befell us in the incident at the U.N. Neutral 
Zone summit has not shaken our resolve to unite Humanity in 
Peace, Dignity and Freedom. The loss of my brother is a blow, 
but not one that will stop us from continuing his work.

The Enemies of Democracy beset us, but it has always been so
for reformers and lovers of Peace; we will persevere and
overcome.  We will find the murderers  of this world's leaders and 
bring them to justice.  We will clear our names and win through 
to Victory.
