^  Citizens, do not forget your duties in this society. Do not forget what 
society has given you. Follow your duties with dedication and vigor. 
Instruct your subordinates with wisdom and compassion. And be on 
the lookout for any who shirk their duties and seek to cheat your family,
your coworkers, your fellow citizens. Report them to your cadre 
members and help us build a strong society in the Chairman's vision.

"As I see no need for this Vendetta to continue, $NAME1,
a pledge of Blood Truce would seem in order."

"Indeed. Blood Truce would be most satisfactory."
"Never! I plan to put an end to your scheming once and for all!"

#FACTIONTREATY

"$TITLE0 $NAME1, your ideals are admirable if a bit misguided and
your faction need not pose a threat to Hive policy. Shall we sign
a Treaty of Friendship to formalize our symbiotic relationship?

"As you wish. The Hive seems a valuable friend."
"No. Your social experiments are a bit too bizarre for me, $NAME3."

"As I see no need for this Vendetta to continue, $NAME1,
a pledge of Blood Truce would seem in order."

"Progenitor: perceive no point either. Mutual agreement: truce."
"Your needs: truth: not same. Continued conflict: beneficial to Progenitor!"

#ALIENFACTIONTREATY

#caption $CAPTION7
"$TITLE0 $NAME1, my noninterference philosophies would seem to make
me the only natural ally for you from among these warring human
factions. Can't we sign a Treaty of Friendship and coexist in peace?

"Hive: safe ally. Treaty: admirable idea."
"Hive: control: too important. Ally: dangerous. Answer: no."
