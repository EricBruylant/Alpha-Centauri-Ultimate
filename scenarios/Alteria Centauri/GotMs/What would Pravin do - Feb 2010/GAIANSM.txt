#BLURB
Mankind fouled its own nest on Earth to the point of suicide.

On this new world, if for no other reason than self-interest, we must
find a better way; and the ethics of our interaction with the Biosphere
must not be set aside lightly even then.  There is a harmonious path 
superior to the excesses of our dead past, and we must find it and 
implement it if we are to prosper as a people and as a moral society.
