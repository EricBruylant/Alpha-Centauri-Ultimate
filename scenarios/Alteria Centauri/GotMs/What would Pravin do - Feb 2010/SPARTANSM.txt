#BLURB
The Colonel expected us to follow the Chain of Command.  We will
do so, and with the knowledge that within that structural discipline we 
are the freest people in the world.  

Spartans, we will show the world that discipline, and we will teach the 
murderous and hypocritical Peacekeepers a lesson they and the world 
will never forget about the true power of a truly free people.

"$TITLE0 $NAME1. My survivalist followers are content to guard their homes
in armed peace. I suggest we sign a Treaty of Friendship
and stay out of each others' way."

"Fair enough, but I shall guard my borders carefully."
"Hardly. A faction armed to the teeth hardly seems friendly to me."

Pledge Blood Truce now or face total destruction."

"Destruction: to be avoided. Truce: agreed."

"$TITLE0 $NAME1, clearly your aims and ours are mutual: survival on
this harsh world we've come upon. With you as Treaty partner, I will be less
of a target for the others, and therefore my people will not suffer."

"Right to defend: important. Treaty: agreeable."
"Weaponry: belies soft words. Treaty: not advisable."
