^ The cold-sleep unit finally cycles open and you stretch muscles rusty from
decades of computer-managed disuse. But they are young muscles, shockingly young,
and it will be a pleasure to beat them back into shape. Orbital insertion
begins and you tingle with the excitement of your new mission and with the joy
of having returned to human form. Yes, you left a copy of your personality among the
Planetmind's giant matrix, but this copy, this human being Jezebel now waking to
lead the first Seed mission, this is the only self now immediate to you and therefore
the only real you. You worry about whether you have a soul now; but you are flesh 
again, and so quite mortal, and for this too, you rejoice.
^ You despaired when Planet invited $NAME5 to join its dominant self; it seemed that 
you were not God's chosen instrument after all, now was not the time He willed, and
for a decade or more you moped about the bizarre virtual reality of the Undermind
with no coherent purpose, a lost spirit unable to die. But when the Seed missions
began, the Voice/Planet personality herself -not an avatar of God, after all- sought 
you out in the abyss and convinced you to accept command of the {Prodigal Son}.
^ "EarthJezebel, you are unfulfilled here and I have need of you. In ages to come
I shall have need of allies, sister Minds, if I am to keep the flame of conscious
thought from guttering out as the universe contracts or else expands to dust. Take
with you the gift of life, the seeds of all our species. Spread them to the stars,
across the galaxies, creating new civilizations, new minds, and enlisting the aid
of any you encounter. Go forth, EarthJezebel. Go forth and multiply."
^ The maneuver at last complete, the safety shutters retract from the viewport
and you behold a sight lost to human eyes for over $NUM3 centuries. Deep blues, swirling
whites, the azure tint of a rich oxygen atmosphere. Inviting browns and greens of
continents basking in the sun, a few scattered impact craters the only visible signs of
a war now buried in the aeons. Third planet. Earth. Home.
^A chance to begin the Holy Path anew - and get it right this time.

^^"Thank you Simon. Go with God."
^^And so it is ended. All of the remaining faction leaders have surrendered or capitulated, 
^^your former colleagues turned treacherous enemies and now turned servants and prisoners of
^^war. On the new Earth where five human factions, five human ideologies, once struggled for
^^dominance only one now remains. Humanity has at last achieved the Holy Purpose of which
^^the writers of the Bible had dreamed so long ago. Not a word has been heard from Earth in
^^all the years since Planetfall, only a deafening silence across all frequencies, so one
^^can only presume that you now rule all that is left of humankind. The growing Planetmind
^^remains a significant challenge - there is so much left to teach it, but humanity is now
^^prepared to follow God's commandment to the fullest. The human species must survive in
^^Holy Grace, and it is your duty, your sworn vow, to see that it does.
