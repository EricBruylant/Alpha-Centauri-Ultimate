^To: Commander Kirkway 
^From: Commissioner Pravin Lal 
^U.N. Headquarters, MY 2150, January 29 
^
^Commander, I am greatly concerned, that recent conflicts on Chiron threaten 
our ambition of returning into space. Therefore, I created United Nations
Space Agency (UNSA). I nominate you to the position of Agency Director.                        
^ 
^I prepared adequate means to build UNSA facilities on one of the islands of
Santa Ana Archipelago, south of Monsoon Jungle and east of Sea of Unity, 
that was scouted 10 years ago by Believers. Spartans have already established 
a base near Geothermal Shallows. So far, we have good relations with Colonel 
Santiago. You can also ask for assistance Lady Deirdre Sky, our long time 
pactmate. Her bases are on Monsoon Jungle coast to the north. Our intelligence 
is sketchy, but there is possible Hive activity in the west. I know, Yang 
can threaten your bases, but still the archipelago is the most safe location 
for UNSA. There is little knowledge on recent drone rebellion in the Hive. 
Watch for Hive rebels in the region. Send a patrol to South 2 Airbase Complex, 
I will send supplies to that location for you. 
^
^Your objective, Commander Kirkway, is to successfully launch our first 
satellite into Chiron's orbit as soon as you can.
^
^Good Luck! 
^Pravin Lal
