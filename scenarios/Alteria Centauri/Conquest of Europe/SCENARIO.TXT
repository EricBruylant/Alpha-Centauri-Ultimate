$TITLE1 $NAME2 of the $FACTION3: In the year 2100, the
French feelings of superiority became too much for everyone
else. The French leader, Jaques LaFleur has stirred the 
Frenchies to war, and the world will not rest. Play as the
French to continue their conquest, or another to put an end
to it. The British are the weakest.
