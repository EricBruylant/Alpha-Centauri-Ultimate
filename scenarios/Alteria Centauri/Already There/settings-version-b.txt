*Important*:
before loading the game the file "caretake.txt" must be overwritten
by the modified txt file "0-scenario-caretake.txt" that is hereby.
(for easy handling I also attached here the original "caretake.txt"
and 2 batch files, so that you don't forget to set the original back
after playing)

2 Scout Patrol 1-1-1 (Pirates 1 Unity Transport Foil and 1 Unity Laser
Foil additional)
2 sea fields with mineral bonus
1 sea field with energy bonus (exept Cult, as Cult is set on Uranium
fields)

---
hidden/sleeping units ("lurker"):
as Alien:
several Sealurks, some Locosts, some MK3
ALL are VERY dangerous
(always where maybe special objectives for settling and/or Culture
objects of the Caretakers)

as Caretaker's units:
mass of very great Mindwors on Manifold Nexus Island
and some very great Sealurks around the island

---
additional Caretaker's weapons:
21 Defence Orbital Pods (unseen until Orbital flight is researched by
minimum one faction, however, later in game the AI may scramble they.
When you get orbital spaceflight, you see all Caretaker's defense pods)
5 MK3 (30-12-3)
4 Tectonic missiles
4 Fungus missiles
2 Planet Busters

Remark: don't believe the Caretakers do have too much power. 
The Ai will not use it (exept you attack the Caretakers) until 
a very late time in the game when you really have the possibility 
to protect your faction and/or win a battle with the right weapon 
(e.g. kill the powerful MK3 with a mind worm).
In the tests (up to 2450 I made) the Caretakers are really peaceful
and, as they don't have a harbour, the can't make an early contact.
The open question is what is better for the human player(s): 
make contact early when getting all commlinks (Secret Project)
or better not. This depends from your strategy as an early contact
may force an early war to Caretakers, and this maybe happen when 
you don't have the weapons for it.
In a single user game the other AI factions don't attack the
Caretakers, exept the Pirates, for a long time. 
Remember: to win in Transcendet isn't possible as long as an alien 
faction exist. So at least you must attack them.
