Kaman Ra Readme:
================
This faction was generated with the faction editor in SMAC-X and designed around "Ra" as portrayed in the MGM film "Stargate".
Many thanks to MGM for the associated graphic.
Also thanks to freechina@angelfire.com for the icon file used to represent the faction bases ("pyramids") which can be found at Apolyton (http://civilization.gamestats.com/smac/).
