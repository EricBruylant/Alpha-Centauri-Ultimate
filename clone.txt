#BLURB
Clones. The ultimate in modern military and industrial technology.
With these we can revolutionize infrastructure with dedicated
genejack workers and increase military manpower tenfold. With
clones we can forge a new and indomitable whole; we can create
a mighty warmachine based on the achievements of a single individual,
an entire army blessed with the same gift that the most advanced
individuals have. With clones we shall prevail!

"This Vendetta wastes precious life and resources, and it is pointless
to waste more lives throwing our soldiers pointlessly at each
other's Perimeter Defenses. A truce is therefore in order."

"No you Unethical Twit!"
