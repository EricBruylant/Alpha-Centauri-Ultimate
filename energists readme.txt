The Energists: a new faction for Sid Meir's Alpha Centauri
by Christian Herwitz (SinfulContortion@aol.com)

Installation is very simple: just extract everything into your main Alpha Centauri/Alien Crossfire directory 
(example: "C:\Program Files\Firaxis Games\Sid Meir's Alpha Centauri\"), and everything will be set (if you 
don't hear the faction blurb when selecting the faction, make sure the file, "energists.mp3" is in your 
"\voices\" directory).
Once you have installed, all you need to do is either load the faction into the game from the Alpha Centauri 
faction select screen (press the "LOAD" button, and then type "energists"), or from the Faction Editor
included with Alien Crossfire (load the file, "energists.txt", press save, replace the file, and then choose to
load it into the game).

Enjoy!
