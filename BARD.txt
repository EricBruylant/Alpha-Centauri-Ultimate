^  It has become a well known fact that music in and
of itself can change the behavior of plants and of animals.
 Our hope is to use music as the focus to bring Planet
and Earth Ecologies together in harmony.

"I suggest we sign a Blood Truce before someone gets
truly ticked off, wouldn't you agree?"

"Hey, no problem here, Blood Truce it is then."
"...and watch as you sing the local wildlife right into
my living room?  I don't think so buddy, your mine now!"

#FACTIONTREATY
#xs 440
#caption $CAPTION7
"$TITLE0 $NAME1, your  about two sandwiches short of
a picnic, but what say me and you sign a Treaty of Friendship."
 Shall we sign a Treaty of Friendship to formalize our
symbiotic relationship?

"I'm not quite sure how to take that, but I will agree
to the Treaty."
"I got your sandwiches right here, $NAME3.  You can
stuff your Treaty with them!"

#ALIENFACTIONTRUCE

#caption $CAPTION7
"As I see no need for this Vendetta to continue, $NAME1,
a pledge of Blood Truce would seem in order."

"Progenitor: perceive no point either. Mutual agreement:
truce."
"Your needs: truth: not same. Continued conflict: beneficial
to Progenitor!"

#ALIENFACTIONTREATY
#xs 440
#caption $CAPTION7
"$TITLE0 $NAME1, my ecological philosophies would
seem to make me the only natural ally for you from among
these warring human factions. Can't we sign a Treaty
of Friendship and coexist in peace?

"Bards: safe ally. Treaty: admirable idea."
"Bards: control: too important. Ally: dangerous. Answer:
no."
