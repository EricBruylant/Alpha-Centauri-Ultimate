"This Vendetta is slowing our ecological research, $NAME1,
a  Blood Truce would be beneficial."

"Of course. A Blood Truce would be excellent."
"Never! I will end your malevolent plans now!"

#FACTIONTREATY
#xs 440
#caption $CAPTION7
"$TITLE0 $NAME1, your faction is acceptable and you
do not pose a threat to my ideal.  Shall we sign a formal
treaty?"

"As you wish. The CCF seems a valuable friend."
"No. You spend to much time in the forest for me."

#ALIENFACTIONTRUCE
#xs 440
#caption $CAPTION7
"As I see no need for this Vendetta to continue, $NAME1,
a pledge of Blood Truce would seem in order."

"Progenitor: perceive no point either. Mutual agreement: truce."

#ALIENFACTIONTREATY
#xs 440
#caption $CAPTION7
"$TITLE0 $NAME1, my non-interference philosophies would
seem to make me the only natural ally for you from among
these warring human factions. Can't we sign a Treaty
of Friendship and coexist in peace?

"CCF: safe ally. Treaty: admirable idea."
"CCF: control: too important. Ally: dangerous. Answer: no."
