SITH FACTION README FILE
created 8-18-99

These are the faction files to play as the Dark Side faction (the Sith). If you are wondering why the file names are the Spartans, it is so that the black faction color displays properly in Patch 4.0. The name of the faction in the game will still be correctly stated as the Dark Side.  Obviously, this will replace the Spartan faction. If you rename these files as sith.* and then edit alpha.txt to include this faction in place of another faction besides the Spartans, it will work fine. 

Files included in this zip file are:

spartans.txt
spartans.pcx
spartans2.pcx
spartans3.pcx
readme.txt

These files are free for anyone to use in any way they see fit. Besides, most of the pics are ripoffs off the internet. The only original pic is the Imperial insignia, which I don't think you'd recognize unless you're an avid Star Wars fan. I drew it using MSpaint.

I tried to replace the spartans.mp3 file ("Superior training and...") that gets played at the beginning with a soundclip from Phantom Menace ("At last we shall reveal..."), but it didn't play properly, probably because the conversion from wav format to mp3 wasn't done correctly. Oh well.
