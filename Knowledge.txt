; FACTION FILE: Pursuers of Knowledge
;
;	Designed By: Xyrex - 1999
;
;	To use this faction -
;		Load SMAC, in the 'Select Faction' menu select your replacement faction (I recommend the University),
;		select 'Load' and type 'Knowledge' (no quotes)	
;
;
;	This faction is part of a series of factions which I plan to release over the next few months
;
;		This faction is an extreme and adjusted version of the University. They have a high research
;		and probe rating (secrecy), and poor efficiency and police ratings: to represent their 
;		lack of ethics, trading and their insufferable superiority complex. (I was going to give them 
;		a +2 Morale rating due to this as well :), maybe later)
;
;
;	I would appreciate any comments, especially one's relating to how I might improve this file, send them to -

Without knowledge we are nothing, knowledge is, of course, 
power, and power must be held by the righteous and kept from 
the cruel and despotic. We shall perform this task.
