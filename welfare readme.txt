The Welfare State (Faction)
How's this for a beauracratic welfare-socialist state?
You get, free with each base:
Children's Creche
Recreation Commons
Research Hospital! (but you gotta fund em!)
Extra talent for every 5 citizens!
Up to 9 pop. before hab complex needed.
Cheaper terraforming (PWA type organization)
Free prototypes (from government pork to defense companies)
Plus, free starting tech: Social Psych
And yes all this is too good to be true!

Now the flip side: no positive social modifiers!!!
-1 Economy
-1 Industry
-3 Efficiency (fortuneately Kiddy creche offsets this to -1)
-1 Probe (loopholes!)
120% hurry costs (corporations charge for $2000 hammers, $6.3 million toilet seats)

What a long list, but only fitting for a bearacratic welfare state.  
Now this might confuse you, but here's some advice: you'd better stay peaceful- switching to military-based policies like Police State will paralyze your economy and efficiency to a total halt.
