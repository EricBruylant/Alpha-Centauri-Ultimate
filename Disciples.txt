#BLURB
Mankind has been blind for thousands of years-for all
of its history. We have come to a place whose wonders
are a hundred-fold more amazing than anything on Earth.
Around us is clear evidence of the will of a higher
power. I bring the Vision to the blind eyes of men.
I bring the Word to the deaf ears of men. I will make
them see it. I will make them hear it.
