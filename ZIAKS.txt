; The Ziaks are an advanced race, who crashed on Chiron the same
; time that the Unity pods did.  They are concerned with only
; sciences, and to them, Diplomacy is a MAJOR science.
; The only problem with the ziaks is that they have no regard for money.
; I created these files with ACEdit.  all of the pics have been
; modified.  Enjoy
; Oh yeah, i want to review it if you modify this, and i will add
; your readme on to mine in the next version.  If you wish me to
; review it, load it in to www.sidgames.com/ac/
