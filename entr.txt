#BLURB
We try to keep things pristine, perfect, pure, undamaged, exactly
as if they were new.  And every time, we are defeated by the
movement of time itself.  Did you ever stop to think that perhaps
time is right, or even that we get more power by going with
it to its logical conclusion, than in struggling vainly against
the flow?
