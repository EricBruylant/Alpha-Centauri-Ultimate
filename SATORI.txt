#BLURB
One would be led to believe that life on another world requires
new rules be written for every aspect of human endeavor, and in
most areas they would be correct. Most areas, save for commerce.
It is in that this area alone that Planet's fungal ravines are
no different from the streets of Tokyo or Berlin.

"This war has cost us both dearly and has returned no profit, $NAME1. 
I'm prepared to call it off so we can both go about our business."

"I was thinking the same, $NAME3. A Blood Truce it is."
"As if I care about the condition of your coffers, $NAME3."

#FACTIONTREATY

"$TITLE0 $NAME1, our factions have both prospered on this alien world, but
if we strethened our trade relations we could be even wealthier. A Treaty
of Friendship would profit us both immensely."

"Then let's sign the paperwork and watch the credits flow in."
"No deal, $NAME3. I wouldn't buy a cup of synthetic coffee from your peddlers."

#ALIENFACTIONTRUCE

#caption $CAPTION7
"War is an impediment to our business ventures, $NAME1. If you pledge a 
Blood Truce with me then we can both get back to what we're really on this
planet to do."

"$NAME3: good judgment. Truce: will sign."
"$NAME3: priorities: poorly chosen. Vendetta: will proceed."

#ALIENFACTIONTREATY

#caption $CAPTION7
"AS different as our people are,$TITLE0 $NAME1, surely you also
can benefit from the economic windfall that House Satori intends to
bring to this planet. If you sign a Treaty of Friendship, I can ensure
a return on your investment!"

"Satori: persuasive argument. Treaty: profittable."
"Progenitors: commerce: obsolete. Treaty: no advantage."
