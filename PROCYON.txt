#BLURB
^  While at first the specimen recovered from the New
Sargasso appeared to be nothing less than a giant amoeba,
subsequent tests revealed a the presence of a complex
nervous system unlike anything yet discovered on Planet.
This researcher apologizes to report that the specimen's
tissue experienced a state of rapid dissolution soon
after dissection.
