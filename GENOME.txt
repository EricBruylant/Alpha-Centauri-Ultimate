#BLURB
^Every human being spends thirty minutes as a single celled organism,
scarcely different from the first paramecia that fought tooth and nail against
nature's cruelty for every evolutionary edge they could find. It is amazing to
think how far we have come since then, and humbling to think how far we have yet
to go.

"War is barbarism, $NAME1. Surely our people have shown themselves to be
more evolved than to remain embroiled in this pointless skirmish. A Blood
Truce is the only sensible option."


"Indeed, let's leave the primitive bloodhsed behind on Earth."
"Your high and mighty act isn't fooling anyone, $NAME3! I'll have no Truce with you!"

#FACTIONTREATY

#caption $CAPTION7
"$TITLE0 $NAME1, the human race on Planet will never reach its full potential as
long as we remain fractured and at each others' throats. Let's sign a Treaty of
Friendship as the first step down the path to future evolution."

"Then let me be the first to take that step, $NAME3. Where do I sign?"
"I can't agree to a Treaty with someone who treats humans as guinea pigs for her depraved experiments."

#ALIENFACTIONTRUCE

"Surely your race has evolved beyond the need for this ludicrous violence, $NAME1.
You must see reason in a Blood Truce."

"Progenitor: understand. Truce: reasonable."
"Evolution: favors the strong. $NAME3: weak. Extermination: inevitable."

#ALIENFACTIONTREATY
#xs 440
#caption $CAPTION7
"$TITLE0 $NAME1, I admire your people's genetic strength and evolved society. 
A Treaty of Friendship would allow both of our races to benefit from one 
another's capabilities."

"Human: much potential. Treaty: beneficial to Progenitor."
"Humans: inferior species. Treaty: weaken Progenitor."
