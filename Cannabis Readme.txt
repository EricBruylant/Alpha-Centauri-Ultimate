Well, I uh... like to smoke and play SMAC.  I got tired of renaming all my own cities, so this faction evolved from there.  It is reasonably well balanced, kind of a combination between the Gaians and the Peacekeepers.  The main advantage the Cannabis League has is its bonus nutrients, minerals, and energy from fungus, so planting fungus late in the game can give them a big advantage.  I like to play with them in place of the Gaians, as they have the same city graphics but are more docile and less likely to attack than the Gaians.

I haven't played a full game against this faction, so if anyone finds any strange behavior quirks, let me know.  Eventually I plan on having better graphics (including new city graphics) and even sound bites for this faction.  I hope you guys like it.

Installation Instructions:
Put all the files in the Alpha Centauri folder.
You then have two options, you can manually Load the faction on the faction selection screen by hitting "Load" and typing "cannabis".  The second option is to change one of the faction names in the alpha.txt file to "cannabis".  If you do the latter, the Cannabis League will appear as one of the 7 standard factions each game.
