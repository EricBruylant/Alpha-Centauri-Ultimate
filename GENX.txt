#BLURB
^ There is always conflict within the flawed human mind.
Right and wrong, good and bad, true or false. These
are a result of the impurities of the human conciousness.
And purifying of the mind is not through removal of
emotions, as Aki believes, but through the removal of
all conflict in the conscience.
