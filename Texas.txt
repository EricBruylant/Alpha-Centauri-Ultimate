^  "Texas will again lift its head and stand among the nations;
it ought to do so, for no country upon the globe can compare
with it in natural advantage and the self of body, to embrace
the self of group and the self of humanity. The goals of the
group and the greater race are transcendent, and to embrace
them is to achieve enlightenment.
