#BLURB
For today, we celebrate the first glorious anniversary of the
Information Purification Directives. We have created, for the
first time in all history, a garden of pure ideology. Where
each worker may bloom secure from the pests of contradictory
and confusing truths. Our Unification of Thought is more powerful
a weapon than any fleet or army on earth. We are one people.
With one will. One resolve. One cause. Our enemies shall talk
themselves to death. And we will bury them with their own confusion.
We shall prevail!

"We cannot afford this expensive and life-costly war. Let us end
it now, so that our two great societies can regroup and rebuild
lest we destroy each other in a fit of blind, manic rage."

"Fine, but I warn you, my forces are ready to be deployed at a moment's 
notice."
"No, $NAME3, you will burn like the poor souls that you executed in the name 
of "order" and "Security"."

"$TITLE0 $NAME1, I am sure you can find me to be a reasonable man,
and my Big-Brother methods need not pose a threat to you. If
we but make a Treaty of Friendship, then our two great societies
can coexist in peace, not interfering with each others business."

"You'd like that, $NAME3, wouldn't you? Very well, but don't think for a 
moment that you can mind-control my citizens."
"No, you frighten me with your absolute control of everything in society."
