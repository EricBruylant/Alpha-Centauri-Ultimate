#BLURB
War; is there anything more pointless in this life than
destroying other life? Sure, the Spartans preach "the
right to take up arms," and the Believers talk about
war "in God's name." But we have been collected from
all over planet and know of the pain of war. From the
brainwashing chambers of New Jerusalem to Deirdre's
nitrogen experiments, they have seen the bad side of
even the most peaceful faction. And we are determined
to avoid the mistakes of Earth as well as the mistakes
of the present.
