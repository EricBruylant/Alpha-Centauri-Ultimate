The Ancients League - A faction file by Dimitri

The Ancients are my attempt at a faction devoted to espionage and
diplomatic manuvering.  This group should require a little creativity
to survive among the more militaristic factions.  Their chief weapon is
their probe teams and their ability to manipulate and gather
information on the their enemies.
The game seems to rate their power as higher than it really is,
especially at the beginning of the game.  (The probe teams can be very
useful for initial exploration, however.  Just keep an eye out for
those mind-worms!)
The best strategy I have found seems to use probe teams and rovers to
quickly explore and pick up those colony pods.  Then expand quickly and
concentrate on acumulating energy credits.  When it comes to combat,
the Ancients low morale makes it easier to try and subvert enemy units
and bases rather than fight it out.  With enough energy credits, the
Ancients are practically invinsible.  (One of my favorite strategies is
to locate and befriend the Morganites.  I then send in probe teams
every turn to steal their money!!)
