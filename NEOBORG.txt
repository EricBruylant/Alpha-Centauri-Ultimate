#BLURB
Discard the weak shell of flesh and bone and embrace the cool
immortality of alloy, silicon and chrome. Long after your kind
has faded into the depths of history my kind will rule without
compare, with nothing beyond our ability. Why learn when you
can program, rest when you can recharge? The machine is the
future, and we are the machine.
