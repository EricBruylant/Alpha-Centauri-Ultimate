#BLURB
If you can provide everything that someone desires, simply tell
him whom he must hate to recieve it. Society, like anything
else can be created synthetically, and humans are simply self-replicating
machines used to produce the raw materials of society. Give
someone thier simple vices, and you have them forever. Problems
exist only because we say they do.
