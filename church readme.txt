I was inspired by some thread in the forums on Apolyton that complains of the "anti-xtian" slant of Alpha Centauri to create a Roman Catholic faction - so here it is.  See if you can lead Pope John Paul III and his disciples to victory from the Vatican on Planet.

I welcome questions or comments of any nature.

By the way, I'm an atheist, but was raised in a Catholic household.
