#BLURB
Men have longed followed the idiom that knowledge is power. This cannot be denied.
But these same men do not follow this idiom to its final conclusion: that knowledge,
like power, will cast men undeserving of its burden into corruption, and in this
manner fell our first home. The lesson painfully learned is this: the power of the
mind to change the world must be guarded as jeaously as the power to split atoms, for
from the first arises the second.
