The material properties of Planet's fungus are unlike anything encountered within Earth's 
ecosystem. Setting aside even its capacity for neural activity, its tensile strength approaches 
that of carbon nanotubes, and its resistance to heat and corrosive forces is beyond any 
naturally occurring substance.The bottom line is this: while Planet presents a harsh, forbidding
wasteland to all other human endeavors, it is the promised land for materials science.

“Our strategic simulations predict an inevitable stalemate for this
conflict, $NAME1. We therefore attach a high value to Blood Truce at this time.”

“I need no simulation to tell me that, $NAME3. Blood Truce is the best choice.”
“That’s funny … our simulations predict your inevitable defeat. We see no value in a Blood Truce.”

#FACTIONTREATY

“You have recently demonstrated enhanced left-brain activity, $TITLE0 $NAME1.
A Treaty of Friendship would exponentially increase our mutual capabilities.”

“Your conclusions are irrefutable. A Treaty is the only rational path for our people, $NAME3.”
“I prefer my right-brain impulses on this one, $NAME3. You can use what’s left of yours.”

“$TITLE0 $NAME1, your devotion to research and your vast intellect make you
a suitable partner. A Treaty of Friendship would exponentially increase
our mutual capabilities.”

“Geometric power: preferable: arithmetic power. Treaty: excellent idea.”
“Logic flaw: Progenitor: no benefit: your commerce. Answer: negative.”
