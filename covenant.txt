What has progressivism brought us? Decades of violence, with man turning on 
man, tearing down his own creations with ever more powerful tools of harm, and
finally bringing an apparent end to the planet of our birth. When humans
given certain forms of freedom they use it for destructive ends. Time and 
time again the complex progressive "fair" systems have been proven to not 
work for people; they are unnatural, wrongheaded, and exploitable. If
we are to avoid the mistakes of Earth's decay and catastrophic fall
we must return to stable and well-organized society which acknowledges the
very real differences between individuals, and has an appropriate place
for all.

Only as a society united behind an absolute leader can we forge an island
of stability and safety on this hostile world.
