^Freedom is a funny thing. Many say they fight for freedom and strive
to protect it, but when a simple man like me becomes multi-sexual, they'll
say s/he is unnatural. They'll say that hir transformation is the work
of the devil. Is it really so unnatural to be simply what you wan't to be?

"This conflict interferes with the freedom of our people,
and my plans for sexual liberation. Will you sign a
blood truce to end this horrible Vendetta?"

"Freedom is an important thing indeed. I'll sing your truce, $NAME3."
"No. I won't let you destroy humanity with your genetic experiments. Your Multi-sexual Mutants won't protect you now, $NAME3!"

#FACTIONTREATY

"You are a wise leader, $TITLE0 $NAME1, and understand the
basic need of all humans: to be what they want to be. A Treaty
of friendship would benifit both our quests for perfection, don't
you think?"

"I agree with what you are saying, $NAME3. Let us both quest in friedship."
"You, on the other hand, know nothing of wisdom, $NAME3. I won't sign a Treaty of Friendship with a Mutant."

"This conflict serves no purpose in my plans for sexual
freedom. Can't we sign a Blood Truce?"

"Progenitor: willing: find other targets. Truce: Agreed."
"Multi-sexuality: not convinient: with Progenitor plans. Ansver to unnatural $NAME3: No."

"$TITLE0 $NAME1, the fact that were from different planets
doesn't mean we can't prosper together. Couldn't both
of us sign a Treaty of Friendship for benifit of both
our people?"

"$NAME3 speaks: words of truth. Birthplace: irrelevant. Treaty: Progenitor: Androgyn. Agreement."
"Progenitor: only true: intelligense. Conclusion: $NAME3: lower being. $NAME3 also: unnatural Multi-Sexual being. No Treaty."
