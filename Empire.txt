#BLURB
No nation or ideology survives long without loyalty.
It is the foundation of armies, whether bought by promises
of wealth and power, or by victory of some idea.  Without
a core cadre of loyal followers, no cause can hope to
survive, for they shall be defeated by a faction willing
to sacrifice.
