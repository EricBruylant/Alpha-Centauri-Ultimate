#BLURB
If I determine the enemy's disposition of forces while
I have no perceptible form, I can concentrate my forces
while the enemy is fragmented. The pinnacle of military
deployment approaches the formless: if it is formless,
then even the deepest spy cannot discern it nor the
wise make plans against it.

"$NAME1, your bases are at my mercy. However, I have
no desire to see this war continue. Will you sign a
Blood Truce?"

"Agreed. This blood bath has gone on long enough."
"Go to hell."

"$TITLE0 $NAME1, think of how advantageous a Treaty
of Friendship between us could be. We could supply the
troops, and you could supply the targets."

"You know,  Miriam's been annoying me again..."
"No thanks, we don't deal with terrorists."

"As I see no need for this Vendetta to continue, $NAME1,
a pledge of Blood Truce would seem in order."

"Progenitor: perceive no point either. Mutual agreement:
truce."
"Your needs: truth: not same. Continued conflict: beneficial
to Progenitor!"

#ALIENFACTIONTREATY

#caption $CAPTION7
"$TITLE0 $NAME1, my philosophies would seem to make
me the only natural ally for you from among these warring
human factions. Can't we sign a Treaty of Friendship
and coexist in peace?

"Insurgency: safe ally. Treaty: admirable idea."
"Insurgency: control: too important. Ally: dangerous.
Answer: no."
