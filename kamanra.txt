#BLURB
Only enlightenment will free the enslaved. I shall
take your mind and through our common link, transcend
mortality. Together we shall walk in the field of reeds.f
of body, to embrace the self of group and the self of
humanity. The goals of the group and the greater race
are transcendent, and to embrace them is to achieve
enlightenment.
