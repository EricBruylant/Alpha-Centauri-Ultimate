You know, it would be prudent if we worked together;
set aside ideological differences and established a
foothold on this hostile planet. No? Makes too much
sense? Ok, have it your way then.

"$NAME1, why are we fighting. There are still a plethora of challenges that need to be tackled, no need to make survival even less likely. Shall we sign a Blood Truce?"

"Good point, the mindworms have been assualting our perimeter again. I'll sign your truce."
"You know what? I just don't like you."

"$TITLE0 $NAME1, all we're trying to do is survive. Care to sign a Treaty of Friendship?"

"Sounds good, we won't get in your way."
"No."

"As I see no need for this Vendetta to continue, $NAME1,
a pledge of Blood Truce would seem in order."

"Progenitor: perceive no point either. Mutual agreement: truce."
"Your needs: truth: not same. Continued conflict: beneficial to Progenitor!"

#ALIENFACTIONTREATY

#caption $CAPTION7
"$TITLE0 $NAME1, my philosophies would seem to make
me the only natural ally for you from among these warring human
factions. Can't we sign a Treaty of Friendship and coexist in peace?

"Unity: safe ally. Treaty: admirable idea."
"Unity: control: too important. Ally: dangerous. Answer: no."
