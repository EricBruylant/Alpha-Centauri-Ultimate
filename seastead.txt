#BLURB
Those who claim their philosophies are correct and seek to
create a society following them would do well to read history.
Hundreds, nay, thousands of designs for society have been dreamed up
by leaders through the ages, and in the end how many of them truly 
worked for individuals and the group, while being stable to internal
and external influences? None. Their paradises will fail. No single human
or ideology can encapsulate all that is needed for a civilization to function.
We are tolerant of our ideological rivals, allowing all variants of 
organizational structure to be tested, from anarcho-capitalism to
socialism and communism. We allow free movement, and allow a
marketplace of ideas to give people what they desire. Each platform 
contributes to our collective defense, but is otherwise left to arrange
it's own affairs. Like this, we prosper.
