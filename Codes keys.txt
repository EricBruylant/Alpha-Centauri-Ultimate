Drones rules code:
Add the associated values for all desired variant rules:
32: Psych-boosting facilities will also boost Lal's bonus talents.
16: "Superdrones", normally caused only by bureaucracy, can now be caused by conquest, -TALENT, and the University's bonus 
    drones.
8:  If a base is all drones, and some are turned into specialists, an equal number will be turned into 
    superdrones.  If a base is all superdrones and it is supposed to have even more drones than that, "phantom 
    drones" will be created.  Superdrones and phantom drones do increase the number of talents needed to prevent
    drone riots.  (Thus, there is no way to stop drone riots other than psych, drone control facilities, and 
    police.)  If a base is all talents and is supposed to have more talents, it will create "phantom talents",
    allowing a specialist base to still have golden ages.
4:  With -1 or lower POLICE, punishment spheres and non-lethal methods will not work.  (Punishment spheres will
    still decrease labs, though.)
2:  Drone-suppressing facilities and projects (but not police) cannot suppress superdrones directly; instead they
    will spend one "point" of drone control to turn the superdrone into a normal drone, and then suppress it.
1:  Drone-suppressing facilities can suppress pacifism drones.

Unit cost formula code:
The options (for unit cost in rows) are as follows:
0,8,16,24: WeaponX(Armor+Chassis)/2^(reactor+1).  Weapon has a minimum equal to (Armor/2)+1, rounded down.  
   Anything other than a scout patrol (1/1/1/*1) has a minimum cost equal to Reactor*1.5, rounded up.
1,9,17,25: WeaponX(Armor+Chassis)*(6-reactor)/20.  Weapon has a minimum equal to Armor/3, rounded up, 
   to a maximum of 4, and anything other than a scout patrol has a minimum cost equal to Reactor+1.  The cost is
   capped at 250 rows.
2,10,18,26:(Weapon+Armor)*chassis/4
3,11,19,27:WeaponX(Armor+Chassis)/4 for fission reactor, WeaponX(Armor+Chassis)/3 for other reactors.  Weapon 
   has a minimum equal to Armor/3, rounded up, to a maximum of 4, and anything other than a scout patrol has a 
   minimum cost equal to Reactor+1.  The cost is capped at 250 rows.
4,12,20,28:(Weapon or Armor, whichever is higher)*chassis/4.
5,13,21,29: WeaponX(Armor+Chassis)*(6-reactor)/20.  Weapon has a minimum equal to Armor-1, to a maximum of 4, 
   and anything other than a scout patrol has a minimum cost equal to Reactor+1.  The cost is capped at 250 
   rows.
6,14,22,30: WeaponX(Armor+Chassis)/4 for fission reactor, WeaponX(Armor+Chassis)/3 for other reactors.  Weapon 
   has a minimum equal to Armor-1, to a maximum of 4, and anything other than a scout patrol has a minimum cost 
   equal to Reactor+1.  The cost is capped at 250 rows.

For codes 8,9,11,13,14,24,25,27,29, and 30, chassis cost is increased by reactor for sea units, and by the 
   amount that reactor increases move speed for air units.
For codes 0,1,3,5,6,8,10,11,13,14,16,17,19,21,22,24,25,27,29, and 30, armor is halved for sea units, and 
   multiplied by 2*reactor for armored air units.  Furthermore, sea units have their cost halved (rounding up) 
   unless they are probe teams, and air units have their cost halved (rounding down), and then halved again 
   (rounding down) if they are combatunits; all these reductions take place before the reactor-based minimum or 
   the penalty for high weapons and armor (described below) is applied.
For codes 0,8,16, and 24, infantry (land units with chassis cost 1) has its cost halved (rounding down), and 
   then 1 added, before the reactor-based minimum or high-weapons-and-armor penalty.  For codes 1,3,5,6,9,11,13,
   14,17,19,21,22,25,27,29, and 30, the same changes are made, but after applying the penalty and reactor-based 
   minimum.
For codes 0,1,3,5,6,8,10,11,13, and 14, another 1 is added to the cost if armor and weapon both have cost more 
   than 1, and another 1 is added if it's a land unit and the weapon, armor, and chassis all have cost more 
   than 1.  Codes 16,17,19,21,22,24,26,27,29, and 30 do the same thing, but for combat units only.
For codes 18,20,26, and 28, the cost is increased by 1/3 for any reactor higher than fission.
For all unit codes, the cost is increased by 25% per point of cost of special abilities.

Pacifism rules:

0.No units produce pacifism drones.
1.Only air units with 2 or more attack produce pacifism drones; interceptors are exempt.
2.Only air units with 2 or more attack produce pacifism drones; interceptors are not exempt.
3.Air units produce pacifism drones, unless they are noncombat (i.e. have no attack) or scout units 
  (i.e. those with 1 attack, 1 defense, and 1 reactor) or interceptors.
4.Air units produce pacifism drones, unless they are noncombat (i.e. have no attack) or scout units.
5.Only combat air units produce pacifism drones;interceptors are exempt.
6.Only combat air units produce pacifism drones;interceptors are not exempt.
7.Only units with 2 or more attack produce pacifism drones.
8.Only unarmored units with 1 or 0 attack do not produce pacifism drones.
9.Only noncombat units and scout units do not produce pacifism drones.
10.Only unarmored noncombat units and scout units do not produce pacifism drones.
11.Only noncombat units do not produce pacifism drones.
12.Only unarmored noncombat units do not produce pacifism drones.
13.All combat units, as well as probe teams, produce pacifism drones.
14.All combat units and armored noncombat units, as well as unarmored probe teams, produce pacifism drones.
15.All units produce pacifism drones.

Equivalently:
-Land and sea units will not produce pacifism drones unless the code is 7 or higher.
-Interceptors will not produce pacifism drones if the code is 1,3, or 5.
-Noncombat units will not produce pacifism drones unless the code is 8, 10, 12, or 14 and they are armored, or 
 the code is 15 regardless of armor.  However, if the code is 13 or 14, probe teams are considered combat units 
 for this purpose.
-Units with 1 attack will not produce pacifism drones if the code is 1,2, or 7.  If in addition they have no 
 armor, they will not produce pacifism drones on a code of 8, and if they also have reactor 1 then they will
 not produce pacifism drones except on a code of 5,6, or 11 or higher
-No unit will produce pacifism drones if the code is 0.

Conventional missile rules:

This controls how the cost and power of missiles are affected by the unit's reactor.

1. They are not affected.
2. The power is multiplied by the reactor value.
3. The power and the weapon cost are both multiplied by the reactor value.
4. The power is multiplied by 2^reactor.  (i.e. doubled for each reactor level.)
5. The power and weapon cost are both multiplied by 2^reactor.
6. The power and weapon cost are both multiplied by 2^reactor, after which the weapon cost is increased by the
   (unmultiplied) power (causing the efficiency of missile weapons to increase with reactor, but fairly slowly).
7. The power is multiplied by 2^reactor; the weapon cost is multiplied by the reactor value.
