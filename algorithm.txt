#BLURB
Those who join us need give up only half of their humanity--the
illogical, ill-tempered, and disordered half, commonly
thought of as 'right-brain' functioning. In exchange,
the 'left-brain' capacities are increased to undreamed
potential. The tendency of Biologicals to cling instead
to their individual personalities can only be attributed
to archaic evolutionary tendencies.
