;
;	To use this faction -
;		Load SMAC, in the 'Select Faction' menu select 
;		your replacement faction (I recommend the University),
;		select 'Load' and type 'Knowledge' (no quotes)	
;
;
;	This faction is part of a series of factions which I 
;	plan to release over the next few months
;
;		This faction is an extreme and adjusted version 
;		of the Hive. They have high efficiency and morale ratings
;		but low support and research ratings. The main thing about
; 		this faction is the fact that, with free
;		punishment spheres in every city, they never have drone riots,
; 		which can lend to some interesting play
;		ideas
;		I'm a bit worried about the -1 research modifier 
;		(the punishment spheres half science as it is) so
;		if you think it makes it to boring / difficult email me at the address below
;
;
;	I would appreciate any comments, especially one's relating to how I
;	might improve this file, send them to -
