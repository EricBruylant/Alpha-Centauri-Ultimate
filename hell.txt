#BLURB
^  Learn to overcome the good side of your nature, embrace the dark side
that is in all of us.  Let it loose to roam the corridors of yourself and 
let it control you.  Only then will you know your true self, and only then
can I control You........

"As I see no need for this Vendetta to continue, $NAME1,
a pledge of Blood Truce would seem in order."

"Indeed. Blood Truce would be most satisfactory."
"Never! I plan to put an end to your scheming once and for all!"

#FACTIONTREATY

#caption $CAPTION7
"$TITLE0 $NAME1, your ideals are admirable if a bit misguided and
your faction need not pose a threat to the Hellborn. Shall we sign
a Treaty of Friendship to formalize our symbiotic relationship?

"As you wish. The Hive seems a valuable friend."
"No. Your social experiments are a bit too bizarre for me, $NAME3."
