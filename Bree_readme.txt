SMAC Method 1 

Copy the Faction text file (FACTION.TXT) and the PCX files into SMAC's root directory. 
Copy the MP3 file (FACTION.MP3) into SMAC's VOICES directory.

Then when you're selecting a faction, hit the load button and type in the name of your faction text file (for FACTION.TXT type: FACTION)


SMAC Method 2 

Copy the Faction text file (FACTION.TXT) and the PCX files into SMAC's root directory. 
Copy the MP3 file (FACTION.MP3) into SMAC's VOICES directory.

Open the file in the SMAC root directory called "alpha.txt".
Make a search to find the line #FACTIONS (its almost at the bottom)
Select the faction you don't want, and type the name of your faction text file
      (FACTION.TXT --> FACTION, FACTION)
Save.

EXAMPLE:                                                
#FACTIONS
GAIANS,     GAIANS
HIVE,       HIVE
UNIV,       UNIV
MORGAN,     MORGAN
SPARTANS,   SPARTANS
BELIEVE,    BELIEVE
PEACE,      PEACE

                                                        
#FACTIONS
FACTION,    FACTION
HIVE,       HIVE
UNIV,       UNIV
MORGAN,     MORGAN
SPARTANS,   SPARTANS

Crossfire Method 1 

Copy the Faction text file (FACTION.TXT) and the PCX files into SMAC's root directory. 
Copy the MP3 file (FACTION.MP3) into SMAC's VOICES directory.

Open SMAC Faction Editor
Load your faction
Choose "Save Faction"
Save over your faction* (or hit cancel, either way the next menu to pop up is the Add menu)
Click the "Add Faction to Game" button
     Note: for some odd reason the SMAC Faction Editor will only add nine factions to Crossfire. This is odd because Crossfire will accept more then nine new factions. If you wish to add more then nine then you must use ‘method 2'

*It might not always be wise to save over custom factions. The SMAC Faction Editor is a bit buggy. If there are aspects to your faction that did not load into the SMAC Faction Editor then they will be lost when you save. On the other hand Crossfire its self might not load all your tweaks either. For example I tried to make a faction who could not use ANY social choices, and when I loaded it into Crossfire it only blocked me from the first eight that I listed.


Crossfire Method 2 

Copy the Faction text file (FACTION.TXT) and the PCX files into SMAC's root directory. 
Copy the MP3 file (FACTION.MP3) into SMAC's VOICES directory.

Open the file in the SMAC root directory called "alphax.txt".
Make a search to find the line #CUSTOMFACTIONS (its almost at the bottom)
Type the name of your faction text file
     (FACTION.TXT --> FACTION)
Save.

EXAMPLE:
