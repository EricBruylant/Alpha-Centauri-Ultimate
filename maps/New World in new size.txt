2 new identical maps here are, one for Alpha Centauri (SMAC), 
the other for Alien Crossfire (SMACX) and its special landmarks:
Don't mix it!

1st - New World in new size and new landmarks (SMAC Great 236 kb - 52 x 104).MP
2nd - New World in new size and new landmarks (SMACX Great 236 kb - 52 x 104).MP

Based in the original map, but made in a medium size that I missed in the 
original SMAC / SMACX versions.

This size is great enough to play a good PBEM but also still playable as IP.
Both have already proposals for the faction's starting points, and all
starting points are made as similar and well balanced as possible.
All starting points got the same bonus fields:
1 nutrient bonus in sea
1 mineral bonus field
1 energy bonus field

The maps are playable with 7 humans or 5 humans and the both Aliens (SMACX)

Present this is my favorite map as no faction has an advantage by position
when starting.

check it out.
