Mapname: Promised Lands
Author: Benny 'Benza' Johansson

Description: A standard sized planet with some small islands and a huge continent. the only problem is that only the western coast of the continent is habitable, the rest is a arid plain, with no water.

Recomend to play as the Belivers or Peacekeepers.

Hope I got the starting positions corrrect.
