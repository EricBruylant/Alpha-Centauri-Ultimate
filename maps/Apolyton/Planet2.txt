This map was initially intended to be the base for a scenario but it turned out to be more fun the scenario  Adam adds: "One of the things I love about games like SMAC is discovering new things, so I've added a few to this map. It's basically just another map of planet, with a few suprises. A few things you might like to look out for are: 
Plateau of the Gods - Apparantly an energy gathering complex built by the alien constructors of the monoliths.
The Lost Continent - Evidence points to this shattered desert being the result of a long ago war.
Avalon - Heaven is a place on Planet, and a few others. Have fun."
