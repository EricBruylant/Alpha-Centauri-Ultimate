--AUSTRALIA map--

Thanks for downloading this map.

This is my second map I've made for SMAC. I decided to do this one because since
I live in Australia and there were other country maps out there, Australia should be
with them as well. You will notice some landmarks and also some other realistic touches
such as Uranium near Jabaluka, Great Barrier Reef and no Tasmania 'cause it's not part
of Australia (just joking). The starting location for each faction is a capital city of
Australia except Canberra and Hobart (there wasn't much room to expand) so Yang moved
to Alice. The factions have been located to each state becuase of there personality or
the look of the faction (Peacekeeper's base look's like St Peter's Cathedral, UoP
is in Melbourne because of Monash Uni, etc.)
If you're Australian or you know quite a bit about it here, you'll notice alot of familiar
places.

*There is also a scenario version out if you want to play it as well. It should be 
in the scenario section of the site you downloaded this scenario from.*
