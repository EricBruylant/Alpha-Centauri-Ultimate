A map that I've made for a scenario which isn't yet finished.
The southern continent has been victim to various buster missiles
over the centuries, hence the hilly terrain and the name of the
map.  I'm not sure that it's a very balanced map, but it can be
interesting.  I always have trouble when I'm put on one of the
small islands...
