Terra.mp
--------
rebuilt the map within the past 2 weeks, basing on the Terra map 
already circulating from an unknown artist (Sparky?).

- correct the continent relations + sizes
- set the resources as they are in real
  (gold, diamonds, iron, coal, oil)
- corrected some size relations of seas and mountains to make it 
  as similar to the real Terra map.
- save it under SMACX (but also playable with SMAC)
- placed jungle at rivers there, where in real is no jungle but
  extendet food (eg Nil, Rhine delta, and such) and setting 
  nutrient bonus fields would give too much
