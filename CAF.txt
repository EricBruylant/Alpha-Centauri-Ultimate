#BLURB
Only by sacrificing the past and its traditions, can a society
make advancements that will lead to a glorious future.  Any
other goals will lead to damning anachronisms.  But this structure
cannot simply rest upon faith that people will do the "right
thing", as the socialists did upon Earth.  Structure has been
found in the universe, and we part of that universe.
