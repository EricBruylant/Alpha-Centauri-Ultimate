#BLURB
What has progressivism brought us? Decades of war, with man turning on man
and tearing down his creations with ever more powerful tools of harm, and
finally bringing an apparent end to the planet of our birth. When humans
given certain forms of freedom they use it for destructive ends. If
we are to avoid the mistakes of Earth's decay,
we must return to stable and well-organized society which acknowledges the
very real differences between individuals, and has an appropriate place
for all. The kingdoms of old Earth provide a template which we must adopt
if we are to survive.

“Our strategic simulations predict an inevitable stalemate for this
conflict, $NAME1. We therefore attach a high value to Blood Truce at this time.”

“I need no simulation to tell me that, $NAME3. Blood Truce is the best choice.”
“That’s funny … our simulations predict your inevitable defeat. We see no value in a Blood Truce.”

“You have recently demonstrated enhanced left-brain activity, $TITLE0 $NAME1.
A Treaty of Friendship would exponentially increase our mutual capabilities.”

“Your conclusions are irrefutable. A Treaty is the only rational path for our people, $NAME3.”
“I prefer my right-brain impulses on this one, $NAME3. You can use what’s left of yours.”
