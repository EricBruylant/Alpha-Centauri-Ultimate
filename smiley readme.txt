Original Readme:
================
Smiley's Anarchists Faction

This faction has all new base architecture with skyscraper spires.  All the graphics are new; leader images, bases, logos, etc.  
Functionally, this faction has problems with being probed and policing the population (both -1), but tends to attract a large influx of citizens, with abnormally high amounts of Drones and Talents.  Additional bonuses for research, speed production, and commerce.  Trade off is NO free base units or free technologies.

A lot of humor is added into this in forms of dialogue, but functionally this is a realisticly usable faction.  And the buildings are real nice.
