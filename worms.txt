"$NAME1, your childern's brains have made excellent breeding grounds for our larvae, but our reproduction cycle is complete and we have no need of fresh corpses right now. Would you like to sign a Blood Truce?"

"Very well, but one day you'll pay for your crimes against us."
"Enjoy our empath rovers, you alien cockroaches."

#FACTIONTREATY
#xs 440
#caption $CAPTION7
"$TITLE0 $NAME1, The Voice has decided you are not an immediate threat. Do you wish to allay any fears she has of you and sign a Treaty of Friendship?"

"Yes."
"To tell you the truth, I'd rather see your species exterminated."

#ALIENFACTIONTRUCE

"As I see no need for this Vendetta to continue, $NAME1,
a pledge of Blood Truce would seem in order."

"Progenitor: perceive no point either. Mutual agreement: truce."
"Your needs: truth: not same. Continued conflict: beneficial to Progenitor!"

#ALIENFACTIONTREATY
#xs 440
#caption $CAPTION7
"$TITLE0 $NAME1, my philosophies would seem to make
me the only natural ally for you from among these warring human
factions. Can't we sign a Treaty of Friendship and coexist in peace?

"Worms: safe ally. Treaty: admirable idea."
"Worms: control: too important. Ally: dangerous. Answer: no."
