^'Bad haircut, stupid coat - the other guy,' he nodded. What other
guy? Maybe he was talking about Deckard. That vet blade runner
had been all over the city today, almost always one step ahead
of me. I just wished that he'd slow down sometimes to let me
get ahead.

"You cannot hope to stand against me, $NAME1. Pledge Blood Truce
now or the watch the human race be wiped out."

"Truce it is, then. I thank you."
"Bluffing will get you nowhere, $NAME3. Prepare to be annihilated!"

"$TITLE0 $NAME1. My survivalist followers are content to continue
living their own lives the way it is. I suggest we sign a Treaty
of Friendship and stay out of each others' way."

"Sounds fair enough, but I suggest you do not interfere with my blade runners."
"You must be joking. A faction with a powerful industry can never be trusted."
