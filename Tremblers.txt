#BLURB
Before you make a move against your fellow man, ask
yourself, are your truly righteous in your actions,
or do you merely wish to benefit yourself? Holyness
is not merely a matter of folowing instructions, or
having good intentions, but in every action thinking
and acting for the benefit of our fellow men, in addition
to ourselves.
