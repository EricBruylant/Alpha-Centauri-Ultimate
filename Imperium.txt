#BLURB
^  In order to survive this brutal world we have to
discard false notions of "human rights." No one is entitled
to anything, and no one deserves anything unless they
earn it; let natural selection sort the weak from the
strong, the rich from the poor. 
^
^        -- Emperor Sepsu Shuhaduku,
^           "Strength is Survival-Creed of the Strong"
