"It is our race's destiny to create Utopia, why don't you give up now, as I see no need to destroy you right now, $NAME1, a pledge of Blood Truce would seem in order."

"Indeed. Blood Truce would be most satisfactory."
"Never! I plan to put an end to your scheming once and for all!"

"$TITLE0 $NAME1, your ideals are admirable if a bit misguided and your faction need not pose a threat to our perfectness. Shall we sign a Treaty of Friendship to formalize our symbiotic relationship"

"As you wish. The Utopia seems a valuable friend."
