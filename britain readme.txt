*-------------------------------------BRITAIN--------------------------------------*

Faction file BRITAIN, created and edited by Geoff { geoff@woody10.freeserve.co.uk }

To install this faction place the britain.txt file and the 3 image files into your
SMAC folder and the MP3 file in the voices folder.Then, when you're selecting a
faction, press the "load" button and type BRITAIN.
This will temporarily replace one of the factions with this one.

I must initially give credit to the anonymous "Imperial" creator who inspired me.
I would also like to thank Valtarien { valtarien@iname.com } without whom the voice
file would not have been possible, thank you for your help.
Thanks also to anyone who has created a faction that I have downloaded and enjoyed
and whose names are to numerous to mention.

This is beggining to sound like an oscars acception speech so I'll leave you now...
bye.

P.S. If anyone reading this is Welsh and eligable to vote remember, vote Plaid
Cymru - The Party of Wales.
