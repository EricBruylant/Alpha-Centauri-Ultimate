"Many cycles have passed since the seeds of human knowledge
have scattered across the face of the new world. So
many human souls, unprepared for the new chapter in
human history. Billions are dead on the old world, because
of human incapacity to conserve pure knowledge and not
twist it into some ville instrument of destruction.
Only by pursuing unmeddled and conserved reseach can
we survive and achieve wonders with this new chance
on Chiron."
