"As I see no need for this Vendetta to continue, $NAME1,
a pledge of Blood Truce would seem in order."

"Indeed. Blood Truce would be most satisfactory."
"Never! I plan to put an end to your scheming once and for all!"

"$TITLE0 $NAME1, your ideals are admirable if a bit misguided and
your faction need not pose a threat to my industrial projects.
Shall we sign a Treaty of Friendship to formalize our
symbiotic relationship?"

"As you wish. The Mech seems a valuable friend."
"No. Your bizzare projects are a bit too bizarre for me, $NAME3."

"$TITLE0 $NAME1, my noninterfering industrial development would
seem to make me the only natural ally for you from among these

coexist in peace?"

"Mech: safe ally. Treaty: admirable idea."
"Mech: war-industry: too important. Ally: dangerous. Answer: no."
