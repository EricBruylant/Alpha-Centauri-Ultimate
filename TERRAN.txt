#BLURB
The mutineers had fled with the ship after our first encounter
with the terror of the worms. We now find ourselves stranded.
My immediate concern is the immense amount of work that we have
ahead of us. The Mission we had come to rescue was a shambles,
and with only a handful of loyal crew I was close to despair.
Yet the Terran League Navy had spent many resources in my training,
and I was not about to fail. I will continue with the rescue mission.
