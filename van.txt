#BLURB
Initial reports of Planet indicated no sentient life. Apparently,
this information was in error. Reconnaissance of our landing
site revealed a xenoform that mysteriously attacks the mind.
First observed behaviour is terror, then wild hallucinations,
paranoid delusions with murderous results, self-inflicted of
other-wise. It is vital to our survival that we come to understand
these phenomina. Our only clue is that the more disciplined
mind seemed less vulnerable. Ivan Lem is leading a team to investigate.
I fear for mankind's survival if we and the other UNITY landing
Pods are unable to overcome the challenges of this New World.
