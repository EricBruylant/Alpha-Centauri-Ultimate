#BLURB
^  Planet's atmosphere, though a gasping death to humans
and most animals, is paradise for Earth plants. The
high nitrate content of the soil and the rich yellow
sunlight bring an abundant harvest wherever adjustments
can be made for the unusual soil conditions.

"As I see no need for this Vendetta to continue, $NAME1,
a pledge of Blood Truce would seem in order. That broken 
Condenser still needs fixing..."

"Indeed. Blood Truce would be most satisfactory. Sorry about the Condenser."
"Never! I plan to put an end to your terraforming once and for all!"

#FACTIONTREATY

"$TITLE0 $NAME1, your ideals are admirable if a bit misguided and your faction need not pose a threat to Former policy. Shall we sign a Treaty of Friendship to formalize our symbiotic relationship, so as we may terraform in peace?

"As you wish. The Terraformers seems a valuable friend."
"No. Your Forming experiments are a bit too bizarre for me, $NAME3."

"As I see no need for this Vendetta to continue, $NAME1, a pledge of Blood Truce would seem in order.I still need to fix that Farm you destroyed..."

"Progenitor: perceive no point either. Mutual agreement: truce. Apologies: about Farm."
"Your needs: truth: not same. Continued conflict: beneficial to Progenitor!"

"$TITLE0 $NAME1, your ideals are admirable if a bit misguided and your faction need not pose a threat to Former policy. Shall we sign a Treaty of Friendship to formalize our symbiotic relationship, so as we may terraform in peace?

"Formers: safe ally. Treaty: admirable idea."
"Formers: terraforming: too important. Ally: dangerous. Answer: no."
