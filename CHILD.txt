"We know that there is no benefit from this Vendetta,
for either of us. A blood truce is therefore in order."

"You are merely foolish children with no respect"

"$TITLE0 $NAME0, we are aware of your ideals and we
find them welcome to our society. Though we may be young,
we guarantee that your trusts would not be misplaced.
A Treaty is therefore appropriate?"

"We are able to see past your youth. I'd say that
a treaty would be most welcome."

#ALIENFACTIONTRUCE

"We know that no good can come out of this war, for
either of us. Therefore, a Blood Truce is the best alternative."

#caption $CAPTION7
"$TITLE0 $NAME1, we may be young but we hope you
can see past that insignificant factor. And likewise,
we wish to be able to see through your frightening appearances.
A treaty would give us both a better view."

"New perception: needed. Solution: Treaty of Friendship."
"Youths: not responsible enough. Response: no."
