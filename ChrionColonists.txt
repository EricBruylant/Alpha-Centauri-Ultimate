#BLURB
Perhaps our greatest tool for taming the centauran
system is a properly engineered forest.  With the proper
mix of trees, such a forest proves highly resilient,
and supplies vital food and raw materials, while requiring
little maintenance once grown.  Such a forest will also
push back the dangerous xenofungus from our cities,
and supplies defensive cover if war breaks out.  Forests
have proven their worth over and over, and with development,
will be useful far into the future.
