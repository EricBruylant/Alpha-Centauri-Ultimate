; 
; In an Usurper experiment into human robotics and digital technology,
; a test subject wentunder a program error. This 'uploaded' his mind
; onto the network. The test subject, Canq, gradualy overtook his
; homebase with help from fellow rebel progenitor AND new allies -
; humans. There is a story to follow this faction, so visit the
; Network Node site soon!
;
; The MCS agenda is to establish a peaceful cybernetic civilization
; in which humans and progenitor could live together side by side.
; Theit hidden agenda seems to be spanning their covert ops all over
; Planet, thus making them even more bent on probe than Data Angels.

After Progenitor experiment: Canq see the truth. Usurpers: brutal and greedy.
Caretakers: too backward and fungus-loving. Humans: barbarious but unique.

potential of Progenitor experiment. This to be done: not in Marr's or Hmee's
way. Human allies: gladly appreciated.
