#BLURB
^The proctor is neither a leader nor a commander. He is a speaker for
the teeming masses whose voice boils within their hardened prison, 
whose jailers once called themselves their representatives. He does not
speak of his own originality, but so that through him what was 
silenced may be heard and never again quieted.
^
^        -- Proctor Omar van Blum,
^           "Can You Hear the People Sing?"
