#BLURB
As the final days of mankind's infernal fate drew to a close,
our mindless hordes gleefully tightened their talons on Earth's
bountiful harvest of freshly slain souls.  But several piddling
factions have fled our final masterpiece, spreading the disease
of humankind outside our fiery grasp.  We shall remedy their
pathetic attempts at escaping our reach, and in doing so insure
the demonic legions' ultimate superiority in this quadrant of
the galaxy.

"Should you agree to a temporary ceasefire, we shall choose far
less... "unpleasant" methods for your imminent demise.  Come
forth, and with our mingling lifeblood let us pledge truce!"

"All hail the Archdemon!"
"You must think me a fool to participate in the destruction of my own species!"

#FACTIONTREATY

#caption $CAPTION7
"I have delighted in hearing of your sinister exploits.  Perhaps,
should you pledge your allegiance to the dark powers, I can
even spare your measly life.  Simply ink your name in blood
on this unholy treaty, and may the demons reign supreme!"

"We shall watch mankind dwindle and be snuffed out together, $NAME3."
"Slavery?  I think not.  I shall never sign my soul for such measly assistance."
