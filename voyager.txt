#BLURB
The scout foil's bow tipped skyward as Hao opened up the throttle, testing what she was really
capable of. Despite the yeoman's warnings I stripped off my breathing mask and allowed

ocean spread out in all directions, and I felt as did Earth's first seafarers, crossing unknown fathoms
in search of fame and prosperity.
