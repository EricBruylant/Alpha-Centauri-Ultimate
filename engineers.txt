#BLURB
Technological advance is an inherently iterative process.
One does not simply take sand from the beach and produce a Dataprobe.
We use crude tools to fashion better tools, and then our better
tools to fashion more precise tools, and so on. Each minor refinement
is a step in the process, and all of the steps must be taken.

"$NAME1, you simply cannot build units faster than we can repair ours. In other words, this war is a stalemate. Would you like to sign a Blood Truce?"

"You are correct, Blood Truce would be most prudent."
"You broke my heart $NAME3. You're nothing to me now."

#FACTIONTREATY

#caption $CAPTION7
"$TITLE0 $NAME1, we've noticed you have been having trouble fighting off the other factions. Would you like to sign a repair contract (Treaty of Friendsip) with us?"

"Yes, that sounds quite helpful."
"Maybe if you slide that Nanometalurgy[E8] tech over here first."

#ALIENFACTIONTRUCE

"As I see no need for this Vendetta to continue, $NAME1,
a pledge of Blood Truce would seem in order."

"Progenitor: perceive no point either. Mutual agreement: truce."
"Your needs: truth: not same. Continued conflict: beneficial to Progenitor!"

#ALIENFACTIONTREATY
#xs 440
#caption $CAPTION7
"$TITLE0 $NAME1, my philosophies would seem to make
me the only natural ally for you from among these warring human
factions. Can't we sign a Treaty of Friendship and coexist in peace?

"Mechanics: safe ally. Treaty: admirable idea."
"Mechanics: control: too important. Ally: dangerous. Answer: no."
